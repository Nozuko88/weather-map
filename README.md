# Weather Map App

This is a React-based Weather Map application that allows users to search for a city, view weather information, and interact with a map to see the weather of various locations. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data and integrates with the Leaflet library to display interactive maps. Open the src you will find a component folder open it and there you will find the WeatherMap.js file. Chane your Directory to weather-map then run everything with npm start.

## Features
- **Search for a city**: Users can search for a city by name and view the weather for that location.
- **Interactive map**: Click on any location on the map to view its weather.
- **Dark mode toggle**: Toggle between dark and light themes for the app.
- **Weather icons**: Display weather icons corresponding to the current weather.

## Libraries and Tools Used
- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **React-Leaflet**: A React wrapper for Leaflet, used for rendering interactive maps.
- **Leaflet**: A leading JavaScript library for interactive maps.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Provides weather data (API key required).
- **CSS**: Basic styling using inline styles and Leaflet CSS for map styling.

## Assumptions Made During Development
- The user has access to the internet to fetch weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API.
- The user has basic knowledge of React and web development.
- An OpenWeatherMap API key is required for the app to function. You can sign up for an API key at [https://openweathermap.org/api](https://openweathermap.org/api).
- The application is designed to be simple and does not handle advanced error cases like network failures in production environments (e.g., handling API rate limits or server downtime).
